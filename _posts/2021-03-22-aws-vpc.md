VPC is a private cloud, within which EC2 server instances, databases, caches, balancers, lambdas, and more are installed and communicate. This is your VPN that can be configured as you please, taking into account all security policies. When you create an account with AWS, you are given and fully configured with a default VPC. This is so you can try AWS services without having to create a new VPC. But why should we then create a new network, if everything has already been done for us? Creating your network will allow you to more flexibly configure the internal network, such as security policies, address ranges, accessibility of resources from outside the VPC (from the Internet).

## Quick brif of stack

We will do all the work on creation and configuration, obviously, in the VPC service. We drive VPC into the search bar from above and go to the service. AWS has the option of using the VPC Wizard, which will customize the network for you based on your preferences. But you will learn little and understand little by using the wizard. Therefore, we will configure each individual component of the network manually.

For a complete configuration, we will go through a few steps:
1. Creation of VPC
2. Subnetting
3. Setting up routing tables
4. Internet access configuration
5. Security setting
    * Access control list (ACL)
    * Security groups

### VPC creation

First, select the region where you want to subnet and create servers in the future.

Go to the `Your VPCs` tab and click on `Create VPC`.

![VPC Creation](/img/2021-03/aws_vpc/vpc_creation.png){: .center-image }

You need to set the name and range of IP addresses within the network. Enter the name that suits you, in the address range we will indicate `10.0.0.0/16`, taking the maximum number (AWS allows specifying from 16 to 28 as the subnet mask, so the maximum number of addresses within the network is 65536 addresses). Then we press `Create` and information on our new subnet opens.

It seems that now you can go to the cherished EC2 service and create virtual machines for yourself, but everything is a little more complicated. It is necessary to create subnets, to which the server instances will be bound.
Also, after creating a personal cloud, default policies are hung on it and it is inaccessible from the outside. We will fix this in the next steps.

### Создание подсетей

Subnets are divided into public and private. Everything created on public subnets is accessible from the outside. This is where, for example, EC2 instances are created. All resources created within a private subnet are available only to other resources in the same VPC. For example, databases are created on private subnets.
There is also such an entity as an `Availability zone`. They are made for physical separation. For example, when one zone falls, you can send traffic to an adjacent zone in the same region.
To create a subnet, go to the `Subnets` tab and click on `Create Subnet`.

We indicate the created VPC as the main point where we create our subnets and then specify the parameters. It is better to name subnets that are understandable and contain information about this subnet. This will make it much more convenient to work with subnets later, and when configuring other AWS resources where you need to specify a subnet, the name will make it clear what you are choosing. We name the subnet `my-test-vpc-eu-west-1a-pub`, select the region `<base> -1a` as the CIDR block, specify the IP `10.0.1.0/24`, which will give us 2051 addresses within the network.

![Subnet settings](/img/2021-03/aws_vpc/subnet_settings.png){: .center-image }

Then we press `Create`, wait a while, and voila, the public subnet has been created. Here we will add our instances that will process requests from the Internet.

Now we need to create a private subnet for the database. Press `Create subnet` again, select our VPC again, set the name `my-test-vpc-au-west-1b-prv`, select the region `1b`, set` 10.0.2.0/24` in CIDR and create a subnet. At the moment, the subnets differ only in name and are not accessible from the outside, we need to fix this and change the routing for the public `my-test-vpc-eu-west-1a-pub`. Routing information can be viewed by selecting a subnet in the list and looking at the `Route table` property.

### Create Internet gateway and Route table

First, let's create an Internet gateway. It is needed so that our EC2 instances on the public subnet have Internet access. The creation process is very simple. Go to the `Internet gateways` tab, click on `Create internet gateway`, set a name, for example, `my-internet-gateway`, and click `Create`.
Initially, the gateway is detached when it is created. We need to bind it to our VPC. Press `Actions` ->` Attach to VPC`, select ours and confirm.

![Gateway actions](/img/2021-03/aws_vpc/gateway_actions.png){: .center-image }

But that is not all. Now we need to create and configure a custom Route table for our public subnet. The default automatically created table for our VPC will be responsible for the private subnet and we will not change this.

Go to the `Route tables` tab, click on` Create route table`, enter the name `my-test-vpc-rtb-pub`, select our VPC from the drop-down list and click create. After creation, you need to change this table so that it points to our created internet gateway. Select our table and go to the `Routes` tab at the bottom. Then we click `Edit`.

![Route tables](/img/2021-03/aws_vpc/route_tables.png){: .center-image }

We need to add a route (`Add route`) and specify the internet as the destination. Internet IP - `0.0.0.0/0`. Do not also forget to specify our gateway as a target.

![Routes editing](/img/2021-03/aws_vpc/edit_routes.png){: .center-image }

Now we need to go back to the list of subnets, select our public subnet and in the `Route table` tab click on` Edit route table association`.

![Routes editing](/img/2021-03/aws_vpc/subnet_associations.png){: .center-image }

Inside, we need to change the default route table to our `my-test-vpc-rtb-pub`. After that, we see that the public subnet is associated with the public routing table, which, in turn, is associated with the internet gateway. Now everything that we run on the public subnet has access to the Internet. If you want to give Internet access to resources added to a private subnet, there is NAT technology and it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

### Security settings

The security group acts as a virtual firewall that monitors traffic. Without adding a rule allowing access to a resource on a subnet, even taking into account the public subnet settings, the security group will not allow such a connection. In addition to the Security group, there are also ACLs that work similarly.
When creating a VPC, in addition to the default routing table, AWS creates the default Security group and ACLs for the private cloud. A couple of useful facts:
1. By default, security groups allow all outgoing traffic
2. When configuring the security group, you cannot add a deny rule. You can only add rules that allow some kind of connection
3. When configuring ACL, you can add deny rules that are applied sequentially based on Rule number
4. In the ACL, it is recommended to number the rules in hundreds (100, 200, 300), so that later there will always be an opportunity to add something in the middle.

For our purposes, the default ACL is quite enough, so we will not create a custom one.

Let's create a Security group for our public subnet, which we will use to connect to the EC2 instance. Go to the `Security groups` tab and click on `Create security group`. Set the name to `my-pub-security-group`. Don't forget to choose our VPC instead of the default one.
Now in `Inbound rules` we need to configure the rules allowing HTTP, HTTPS and SSH traffic for the connection and server settings.

Note: You can create a Security Group for a database right when you create a database instance.

We now have a fully configured VPC with public and private subnets configured to connect on ports 80, 443, and 22 and with internet connectivity. In the following articles, we will look at how to create and configure EC2 instances for the server and RDS instances for our database.
