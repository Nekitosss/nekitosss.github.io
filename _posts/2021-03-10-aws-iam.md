When you develop your own indie application, you will certanly face the need to have a server database and at least any simpliest backend logic. First and easy solution will be use `Cloud Kit` (Apple) or `Firebase` (Google) frameworks. They cover many cases, but not give you flexible customisation if you need something more than a primitive level.

This is where cloud providers come in game. There are quite a few of them, but most popular is Amazon AWS. An all-in-one platform that provides lots of services for development. I thought that its going to be easy to start use all of this, but required skill level, needed to stack configuration turned out to be higher than I go at the moment of start of work (and the current one ðŸ˜‚ ). Therefore lets figure it out together how to build up our own stack with server and database, buy domain and connect it and how to start using existing variety of cloud technologies.

At first our eyes are dazzled to cover all possible variants of using AWS. On screenshot above only third of all existed. And you coulnd not easily understant  for what which service is responsible. Average stack that we are going to build:
1. iAM - service for authorization and accesses
2. VPC - virtual private network configuration
3. RDS - database hosting
4. EC2 - virtual machine in cloud
5. Route53 - service for working with domain names (both public and private)
6. ECR - storage for docker images for deploying to EC2

Note that we will make the most of free tier - free services from AWS. Not all parts of stack are free (buing a domain, for example), but for the purposes of this tutorial that will be enough for us.

## AWS iAM

Lest start with the easiest one - iAM. Type `IAM` in search field at the top of the page and move to service page (should be top search result).
![IAM Selection](/img/2021-03/aws_iam/iam_selection.png){: .center-image }

Let's take as initial that you already have registered and logged into root account. Amazond does not recomment use it in any way other than initial configuration and global access management. So let's create administrator account that we will use for all work over AWS.

AWS iAM consists of 4 main parts:
1. Policies
2. Roles
3. Users
4. Groups

This is make for convenient management of huge number of users. For example, instead of re-creating user when you want to change his access to something, you may just delete Policy from user. So let's create admin user.

![IAM Groups](/img/2021-03/aws_iam/group_tab.png){: .center-image }

Click on "Create New Group" then type name. "Administrators", for example. At the stage of policies seelction choose `AdministratorAccess`.

![IAM Admin access](/img/2021-03/aws_iam/admin_access.png){: .center-image }

Then click "Create Group". We created group of administrators to which we should add new user.

Move to "Users" tab and click "Add User". Type name (Admin), then we choose both access levels (Programmatic access Ð¸ AWS Management Console access) and then create password.

![IAM Create user](/img/2021-03/aws_iam/add_user.png){: .center-image }

Then go to Permissions page and select administrators group that we created.

Type "Next", leave "Tags" empty, create role and on page of created role we HAVE TO cypy and save `Access key ID` and `Secret access key` for further cli usage.

Great, we have created user. Not we have to open our root profile and look for the account numer. On the time of creating this article you can click on profile in the upper right corner and see the number. Amazon changes side design periodically, so this may change.

Now log out from our root account and log into created administrator that we will use for all manipulations with AWS.
For some puproses in future (for example, for access from EC2 to ECR) we will create additional roles to not store administrator credentials on our instances.

Author is newbie in backend development and shares his experience after reading documentation, watching a video and after both successfule and not very successful attempts to get his server up and running.
